# Decision-Tree-Learning

This is a simple implementation of the Decision Tree Learning Algorithm which has been implemented on the [Insurance Company Benchmark (COIL 2000)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Insurance+Company+Benchmark+(COIL+2000)). 
An accuracy of about 88% has been found on the test data.
Also methods like early stopping and pruning the decision tree have been implemented in order to avoid overfitting. And this has resulted an increase in the accuracy of prediction on the test data (about 94%).
